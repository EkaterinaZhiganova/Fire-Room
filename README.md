The file is too big to push it into the GitHub.
The Fire Room is part of the "Four Elements" project, which consists of an earthen section, a water room, a cloud area, and a fire room. 
Project created by Jessica Kollberg, Mattias Lars√©n, Mats Svanborg and Ekaterina Zhiganova.
The point is to go through the room from beginning to end, take the rune and return to the portal at the beginning of the room.
All models for creating a room are taken from the asset store.
There are columns in the room, from which flames burst out. The particle effect was also taken from the asset store, but the script for it was created by me. 
The room contains objects with animation: a cage and a chest. The animation was created by me. 
The lava flowing under the bridge and across the floor is also scripted by me. If a player is caught in a lava or fire trap, he starts the game from the start position.
Some objects in the room have a sound: torches, a chest and a cage. To control the sounds, I created few sound areas.
